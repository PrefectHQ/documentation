# Prefect Versioned Documentation

This repository contains Prefect's versioned documentation.
This repository builds the Prefect 3.0 docs at [docs-3.prefect.io](https://docs-3.prefect.io) temporarily.

Mintlify is used to host the documentation.

See the [Mintlify documentation](https://mintlify.com/docs/development) for more information on how install Mintlify, build previews, and use Mintlify's features while writing docs.

.mdx files are Markdown files that can contain JavaScript and React components. They are used to create interactive documentation.
